# Sorting Algorithm visualizer in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For UI I've used a free bootstrap theme called [Darkly](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/). 
I created this project to refresh my sorting algorithm chops and also it looks neat ðŸ˜„. If you're new to sorting algorithms you can slow the speed down and see the various comparision and swapping steps the algorithm goes through. This visualization will enhance your understanding of the algorithm.

## Check out the [LIVE](https://darshit-singh-resume.netlify.app/) version.

## Current Algorithms:
As of now this project can visualize three algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort âœ…
2. Merge Sort âœ…
3. Quick Sort âœ…

## If you want to run this project locally on your machine

You can just download the code, or clone the repository. Type in:
1. `npm install` 
2. `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Thanks for checking it out :)
